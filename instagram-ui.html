        <h1>Instagram-UI - Project Details</h1>
      <p>
        Creating an Instagram UI clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a great project to showcase your front-end development skills. Here's a brief overview of how you might approach building it:

  <h2>1. Structure with HTML</h2>
       Header: The header typically includes the Instagram logo, a search bar, and icons for navigation (home, messages, notifications, profile).
       Main Section: This includes the stories section, post feed, and a sidebar.
        Stories Section: A horizontal scrollable section displaying user stories.
       Post Feed: Each post consists of a user avatar, username, image, like/comment/share buttons, and a section for comments.
        Sidebar: This section may include suggestions for users to follow and a footer with links like About, Help, etc.
  <h2>2. Styling with CSS</h2>
       Layout: Use Flexbox and Grid to create responsive layouts. The header and sidebar can be fixed, while the main feed scrolls.
       Responsive Design: Media queries are essential to ensure the UI looks good on various devices, mimicking Instagramâ€™s adaptability.
     Styling Components:
     Header: Typically styled with a sticky position to remain at the top.
     Stories Section: Use overflow-x: scroll; to make it horizontally scrollable.
    Post Feed: Flexbox for post components, and grid-template-columns for a neat layout.
     Icons and Buttons: Use SVGs or Font Awesome for scalable icons.
<h2>3. Interactivity with JavaScript</h2>
     Story Interaction: JavaScript can be used to make the stories section interactive, showing a modal with the story when clicked.
      Like Button: Toggle the heart icon between filled and outlined using event listeners and class toggling.
      Comments: Add the ability to post comments dynamically using JavaScript, appending the comment to the post feed.
      Navigation: Handle navigation between different sections (home, messages, profile) using JavaScript to load different content dynamically.
<h2>4. Advanced Features</h2>
Image Uploading: Simulate the image upload feature by integrating a file input and previewing the image before posting.
Follow Suggestions: Implement an algorithm to display suggested users based on predefined criteria or randomly.
Dark Mode: Add a toggle for dark mode, adjusting the UI colors dynamically with CSS variables and JavaScript.
